## **Feature Implementation Details**

### **Feature: Event-Driven Email Notifications with Celery and Kafka**

#### **Overview**
The goal of this feature was to refactor the email notification system to use an event-driven architecture. By leveraging **Celery** as the task queue and **Kafka** as the message broker, the system can handle email notifications efficiently and at scale. This approach ensures that critical events, such as account verification, account locking/unlocking, role upgrades, and professional status upgrades, trigger timely email notifications.

### **Implementation Steps**

1. **Setting Up Kafka**:
   - Kafka was configured as the message broker to handle event-driven communication.
   - Topics were defined for each event type:
     - `email_verification`
     - `account_locked`
     - `account_unlocked`
     - `role_upgrade`
     - `professional_status_upgrade`

2. **Refactoring the Email Notification System**:
   - The existing email notification logic was refactored to use **Celery tasks** for asynchronous processing.
   - Each event type was mapped to a corresponding Celery task, ensuring that email notifications are processed independently of the main application flow.

3. **Defining Event Types**:
   - A centralized `event_types.py` file was created to define all event types as enums. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors when referencing event types.

4. **Implementing Celery Tasks**:
   - Celery tasks were implemented to handle each event type. For example:
     - The `send_verification_email` task processes `email_verification` events and sends account verification emails.
     - The `send_role_upgrade_email` task processes `role_upgrade` events and notifies users of their new roles.
   - Tasks were designed to be idempotent and retryable in case of failures.

5. **Fallback Mechanism**:
   - A fallback mechanism was implemented to handle scenarios where Kafka or Celery fails. In such cases, emails are sent directly using an SMTP client.

6. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Unit tests were written to validate the functionality of Kafka integration, Celery tasks, and email delivery.
   - Edge cases, such as retrying failed tasks and handling invalid event data, were thoroughly tested.

7. **Logging and Monitoring**:
   - Logging was added to track the flow of events and identify issues in the pipeline.
   - Errors in Celery tasks and Kafka message processing were logged for debugging and monitoring.

### **Key Benefits**
- **Scalability**: Kafka and Celery enable the system to handle a high volume of email notifications efficiently.
- **Reliability**: The retry mechanism ensures that failed tasks are retried, reducing the risk of missed notifications.
- **Maintainability**: The modular design of the event-driven architecture makes it easier to add new event types and extend functionality.
